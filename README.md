## Synopsis

In this project, we fit a simple linear model to predict delays in arrival times of VBZ public transportation vessels using data of 4 weeks.

To fit the model, we use the predictors 'weekday', 'vehicle type', 'temperature' and 'precipitation'. 'weekday' and 'vehicle type' are categorical predictors. 'temperature' and 'precipitation' are continuous predictors. 

We obtain data for the predictors 'weekday' and 'vehicle type' from Open Data Zurich (https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/opendata) and data for the predictors 'temperature' and 'precipitation' from http://www.tecson-data.ch/zurich/mythenquai/.

The delay in arrival times, which is the quantity we want to predict, we obtain from Open Data Zurich as well.

The data set we use for fitting the model contains ca. 6 mio data points.
